# The Tiny Marmalade Game
This is a small project made for [`The Tiny Marmalade Company`](https://thetinymarmalade.com), as a love letter to all they do. It is a fun, cosy yet sometimes overweling game inspired by the process of getting all of the compnay's delicious produce into those cute little jars.
