# The Tiny Marmalade Game
This is a small project made for [___The Tiny Marmalade Company___](https://thetinymarmalade.com), as a love letter to all they do. It is a fun, cosy yet often thrilling and exciting game inspired by the hard work the company puts into making all of their delicious product and putting them in those qute little jars.
